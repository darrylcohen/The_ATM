### **Welcome to _The ATM_**

The requirements were to build a small ATM machine to deposit and withdraw transactions from multiple accounts

I broke the problem down based on functionality and created objects

+ Account : a bank Account
+ Viewer : responsible for screen activity
+ Controller : logic that controls the flow
+ Data : holds onto the data

I found that if not set up correctly, this approach is difficult to maintain. I would need to learn more about programming design. Happy that my approach was to separate who does what.
